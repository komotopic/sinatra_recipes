Recipe Webapp for Sinatra

The web app I created is the base for a recipe website. A user can signup, login, create, edit and delete their own
recipes. They can also view other recipes in the database. 
This project was for my second phase at flatiron school. The biggest challenge I faced with the project was catching up
and completing it on time, as I was a few weeks behind.
I was hoping to include alot more on it but time didn't allow it. The final product would have been alot cleaner looking and
would have had features like a modular creation and edit page where you could add lines of ingredients and cooking instructions, and
an area on each page to include pictures.
